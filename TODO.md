# Stuff I Gotta Do Ya Know

## History command set stuff
- [ ] Verfiy functionality of `history` command
    -> All custom filters and commands need to be applied and tested correctly
    -> Make sure -n --days flag is correctly filtering and fetching the correct amount of days
    -> Make sure file search is behaving how I would like it to. i.e.: grep search within files like a nvim search using fzf and rg
    -> Remove "history stats" search command - it's useless
    - [ ] Test all of the above and make sure it's working correctly
