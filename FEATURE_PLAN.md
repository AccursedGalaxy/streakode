# Streakode Feature Implementation Plan 🚀

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the history command, transforming it into a powerful tool for developers navigating their commit history.

## Command Flow

1. User enters `sk history` to start the interactive search
2. User finds and selects a commit using fuzzy finder
3. Upon selection, an action menu appears with the following categories:

## Available Actions

### 1. Code Investigation Actions 🔍
- View full diff of the commit
- View diff of specific files in that commit
- Browse codebase at commit point (temporary branch checkout)
- Compare with other commits
- Show branch containment information
- Interactive file browser for complex changes

### 2. Code Recovery Actions 🔄
- Cherry-pick commit to current branch
- Revert commit
- Create new branch from commit point
- Export patch to file or clipboard
- Interactive recovery wizard for complex operations

### 3. Analysis Actions 📊
- Detailed commit statistics
- Related commits finder (same file modifications)
- Commit relationship viewer (children/parents)
- File blame information
- Impact analysis (downstream effects)
- Code churn visualization

### 4. Communication Actions 📢
- Copy commit hash to clipboard
- Copy formatted commit message
- Generate shareable links (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
- Export commit details to various formats
- Create commit summary report

### 5. CI/CD Context Integration 🔄
- Build status viewer
- Test results display
- Deployment status tracker
- Environment distribution map
- Pipeline visualization

### 6. Issue Tracking Integration 🎯
- Related issues/PRs viewer
- Bug fix history for affected files
- Impact analysis on known issues
- Automated release notes generation
- Issue statistics and trends

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Actions 🚀

   - Browse code at commit point
3. Add code recovery functionality:
   - Cherry-pick
   - Revert
   - Branch creation
4. Implement communication tools:
   - Copy hash/message
   - Generate shareable links

### Phase 2: Analysis & Integration 🔗
1. Implement analysis features:
   - Commit statistics
   - Related commits
   - Impact analysis
2. Add CI/CD integration:
   - Build status
