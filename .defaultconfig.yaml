# This is the default configuration file for Streakode.
# To use this configuration:
#   1. Copy to ~/.streakodeconfig.yaml for default profile
#   2. Copy to ~/.streakodeconfig_<profile>.yaml for specific profiles
#      Examples: ~/.streakodeconfig_work.yaml, ~/.streakodeconfig_home.yaml
#
# Profile Usage:
#   - Run with specific profile: streakode --profile work
#   - Set default profile: streakode profile work
#   - Show current profile: streakode profile
#   - Switch profiles: streakode profile home
#
# Note: Each profile maintains its own independent configuration,
# allowing you to have different settings for different contexts
# (e.g., work vs personal projects).

# This should match your Git configuration for the profile
